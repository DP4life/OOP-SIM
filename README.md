# OOP-SIM

I have completed the simulation. The code is a bit messy, because I was a little too ambitious with my idea and it was hard enough just to get it to work. So I abandoned any attempt at making the code conform to any principles. That is why I have a lot of private variables with useless getters and setters (the remnants of the enapsulation lab) right next to public variables. Here is the class diagram of my program
